# goodtimer v3.4.0 release notes

## 🎁 New features

* `onInterval` and `onTimeout` callbacks for `new Timer` now receive the instance of the timer as the first
argument of each. This allows you to access the timer instance through an argument rather than `this`, and enables
  usage of arrow functions in callbacks. Old way of using callbacks (and accessing timer instance via `this`), is still supported.
  
## 🐞 Bug Fixes

* Order of events re-arranged in `onTimeout` callback during `Timer` reaching 0. Which prevents internal functions from pausing the timer after `onTimeout` function might unpause it. Order is now:
    * call `onInterval` (if `options.finalInterval` is `true`)
    * pause the timer
    * call `onTimeout`
    * Reset time and unpause (if `options.repeat` is `true` or `> 0`)
